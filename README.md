# Sesame-Plant-Disease-Classification
This project is created for the High Level Computer Vision Class of 2021 at the University of Saarland. The goal of the proposed project is to improve on a previous model for detecting disease in sesame plants. Given the small size of the dataset, the previous method has been reported to overfit. Hence, in the proposed project, two methods will be explored to overcome this issue: transfer learning and self-supervised learning.
